        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
          In this JavaScript course, you'll start by understanding
          <strong>why learning JavaScript</strong> is crucial for creating
          dynamic web applications. You'll write your first program,
          <strong>"Hello World,"</strong> and learn how to link JavaScript to
          <strong>HTML</strong> for interactive websites. We will dive into
          <strong>values and variables</strong>, mastering
          <strong> conventions</strong> and <strong> types</strong> like
          strings, numbers, and booleans. You'll explore how to use
          <strong>let, const, and var</strong> for variable declarations,
          perform <strong>arithmetic operations</strong>, and understand
          <strong>operator precedence</strong>. You'll also learn to work with
          <strong>strings and template literals</strong> for cleaner, more
          efficient code. Decision-making will be covered with
          <strong>conditionals (if-else)</strong>, and we'll explain the
          difference between <strong>type coercion</strong> and
          <strong>type conversion</strong>. We'll cover
          <strong>truthy and falsy values</strong> and use
          <strong>logical operators</strong> to enhance your decision-making
          code. Additionally, you'll understand how to use the
          <strong>switch statement</strong> for multiple conditions,
          differentiate between <strong>statements and expressions</strong>, and
          simplify logic using the <strong>ternary operator</strong>. Finally,
          you'll get an overview of <strong>JavaScript releases</strong>
          to understand the evolution of the language.

          <strong>functions</strong>, and we'll compare
          <strong>function declarations vs. function expressions</strong> to
          understand their differences. We'll also cover the concise syntax of
          the <strong>arrow function</strong> and explore other
          <strong>general topics related to functions</strong>. You'll then
          learn about working with <strong>objects</strong> and
          <strong>arrays</strong> to manage collections of data effectively. The
          course will also introduce loops, starting with the
          <strong>for loop</strong>, followed by the <strong>while</strong> and
          <strong>do...while loops</strong>. Finally, you'll understand the use
          of <strong>break and continue keywords</strong> to control the flow of
          loops and exit early or skip iterations as needed.
